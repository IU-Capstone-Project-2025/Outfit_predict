# Machine Learning

This directory contains the core machine learning models and logic for Outfit Predict.

## ü§ñ Models

We use a combination of models to power our outfit suggestion engine:

- **Object Detection (YOLO)**: To identify and locate clothing items in an uploaded image.
- **Image Embeddings (FashionCLIP)**: To convert images of clothing items into vector embeddings, which allows us to perform similarity searches.
- **Clothes Type Classification**: We utilize FashionCLIP to classify the type of each wardrobe clothing item (e.g., "t-shirt", "jeans", "shoes").
- **Style Classification**: We utilize FashionCLIP to classify the style of an outfit (e.g., "casual", "formal").

The pre-trained model weights are stored in this directory and are managed using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1.  **Image Segmentation**: When user uploads image, we identify the clothing type of this image. We do this with predefined text embeddings of clothing types and user's image
2.  **Embedding Generation**: After the clothing type classification, we obtain calculated embeddings for this particular image.
3.  **Similarity Search**: These embeddings are stored in the [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) vector database. To find matching outfits, we perform a similarity search between the user's clothing embeddings and the embeddings of clothes in our pre-styled outfit database.
